# DeepLearningOnAndroid 

My First attempt at writing an article, really excited :smiley:. Check out the article accompanying this tutorial.
 * [article link](http://www.google.com)

This repository contains the material for deploying deep learning models on mobile and embedded platforms. I plan to make this a one stop tutorial to deploy any kind of Neural Network developed on any framework like Tensorflow, Pytorch, CNTK etc.

Tutorials are created as jupyter notebooks so that instead of just reading or just seeing code at a time, you can better understand reading while executing actual code.

##### Tensorflow dependency for Android app
```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-android:+'
}
```
