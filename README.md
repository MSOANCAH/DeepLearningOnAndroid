# DeepLearningOnAndroid 

My First attempt at writing an article, really excited :smiley:. Check out the article accompanying this repository.
 * [article link](http://www.google.com)

This repository contains the material for deploying deep learning models on mobile and embedded platforms. I plan to make this a one stop tutorial to deploy any kind of Neural Network developed on any framework like Tensorflow, Pytorch, CNTK etc.

Tutorials are created as jupyter notebooks so that instead of just reading or just seeing code at a time, you can better understand what you read while executing actual code. 

## Audience 
***This series of tutorials cover not just how to deploy a model on android but assumes a reader to have no understanding of deep learning, android development and minimum coding experience.***

>Above said, this repo requires a reader to just know 
* how to run a jupyter notebook 
* deploy an android app on a device using android studio.

**Yes, no coding required!** (All non-coders cheers!!)


## Overview
This repository provides to the point tutorials for deploying any type of deep learning models created on any deep learning framework on mobile platform ( Tensorflow models on Android devices as of now ). Most of the articles currently available online mostly give steps followed by the authors to deploy, without providing sufficient explaination why it is being done and what is happening behind the scenes. This creates problem when we have to deploy a new model with different Inputs and Outputs.

To ensure readers have a thorough understanding of what they are doing I will be covering fundamentals of Tensorflow architecture and its fundamentals a deep learner (:p) should know.
